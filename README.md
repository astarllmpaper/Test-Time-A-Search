Test-Time A* Search (TTA*),

We propose Test-Time A* Search (TTA*), a framework that equips language models with structured,
iterative reasoning via tree-based search. TTA* consistently outperforms zero-shot chain-of-thought
on multiple mathematical reasoning tasks, validating the effectiveness of combining classical search
with modern LLMs to systematically discover high-quality solutions.

All dataset benchmarks used are seen in their respective folders. The TTA method is implemented in GSM8K as "astarllm.py".
